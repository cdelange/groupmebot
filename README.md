### Acknowledgements
These were both helpful repositories that I emulated in some of my Yahoo API calls. There repositories have great README's to help understand Yahoo's confusing API and whatadewitt's Node wrapper module for the API makes it a breeze to use. All I that was left for me to do was implement the OAuth2 processes.
